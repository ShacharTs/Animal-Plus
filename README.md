# Animal Plus

## Overview
The **Animal Plus** mod enhances Minecraft gameplay by giving players control over the aging and breeding mechanics of passive mobs.  
With this mod, you can skip the long wait for animals to grow up or breed, adjust cooldowns per mob, check values, and reset them to defaults â€” making farming much faster and more efficient.

## Features
- **Adjust Passive Mob Aging & Breeding:** Change the cooldowns of passive mobs, such as cows, chickens, and pigs.
- **Check and Reset Cooldowns:** Instantly check current values or restore defaults.
- **Per-Mob Settings:** Each mob has its own individual configuration.
- **Cross-Mod Support:** Fully compatible with other mods that use the standard Animal API, so custom mobs from supported mods can also benefit from Animal Plus features.
